                            <p>Hello everyone and welcome to my portfolio. My name is Sam Cotter and I was born and
                                raised in Seattle,
                                Washington. I graduated from Landmark College in 2012 with an Associates Degree in
                                Business
                                Administration. I graduated from Southern Oregon University in 2017 with a Bachelors
                                Degree in Business
                                Administration with a Minor in Philosophy. </p>
                            <br>
                            <p>When I graduated from college in 2017 I had no real idea what I wanted to do with my
                                life. I tried
                                starting my own business, which failed. I spent some time working for my dad, and
                                working for the car
                                sharing service Zipcar before I got my current job at BMW Seattle. </p>
                            <br>
                            <p>In my free time, I enjoy working on my car, building models, flying my drone, and
                                spending time with my
                                family. I like going up to my familyâ€™s vacation house on Camano Island to either get
                                away to get
                                important work done, or to just sleep. </p>
                            <br>
                            <p>I am excited to get started and to show how ready I am to become a developer. </p>
                            <br>
